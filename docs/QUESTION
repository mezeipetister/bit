                                   QUESTIONs

1. Asset activation_date type

    Currently we use NaiveDate as data type. But it makes a few question about
    date localization. More precisely we cannot apply localization as we do not
    have timezone.

    For example we need to return a last depreciation date, but without timezone
    details just as a NaiveDate. It it ok?

2. BIT data model

    We use Storage<T> as an in-memory data storage, so mainly we manage
    everything in memory as a RUST data type and store the data modifications in
    disk. In the case of BIT we use a data modell, like storing everything per
    repository in a single storage, so in a single data file.

    It's experimental, but should be fine till we have a few thousand records
    per repository. After a million record its really experimental. Read should
    be excellent till as many records we have - and as they can fit in memory -
    but write is a question - as we do not know exactly how Storage<T> store the
    data: storing everything in all the time, or just patching it? No idea.
