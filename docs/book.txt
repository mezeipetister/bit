1) Definitions

  In BIT we have the following definitions:

  Repository
  
    Working directory that contains all the BIT data related to a business
  entity. Bit mainly contains double entry book keeping records, and repository
  related settings and documents.

  Entry
  
    User input entry that contains some small size change of the current
  repository. Entry can be note, account, setting, blob or any other BIT
  specific data (change).

  Commit

    Group of entries in the current repository. A commit is Local commit until
  its pushed to the repository. Commit has a unique SHA1 ID, that is calculated
  by the related entries. SHA1 ID also a verification possibility.

  Uncommited

    Series of entries that are not part of any commit. Typically new entries
  before doing a commit.

  Remote (Log)

    BIT remote log. This contains all the valid and pushed BIT commits in time
  order.
  
  Locale (Log)

    Bit log located locally. BIT sync its log with remote with pull and push
  requests.

  Ahead of remote

    When the local log contains unpushed commits.

  Behind of remote

    When we have unpulled commits from remote. Local log is behind the remote
  log.

  Clone

    Command. Clone repository from a remote address.

  Pull

    Command. Pull repository changes from remote.

  Push

    Command. Push local commits to remote.

Commit

  - ID: SHA1 (e.g. 45daab4e7b41a5a926afb0973dbf600c76956a6a)

4) BIT Versions

  Repository based BIT version management. Multiple BIT versions can be
installed in the same time. The current BIT working directory specify its
BIT version. That version should be installed automatically - if not installed -
and used to manage that specific BIT repository.

      /VERSION-N      - ..
    /data
      repositories    - local repositories db; contains repo paths
    /bitup            - bitup binary

  bitup
    update (-y)                   - update bit default version
